# Stadium-Menagment
Our project goal is creating a simulation about the customer’s entrance management in a stadium before watching a football match. The simulation includes the security checks, the sales ticket point, the check-in point, the catering point and all the queue that the customer must do before reach every service point.
We considerate also some difference between the tickets that the customer can buy, we have the normal one, and the VIP ticket, which the customer already have when they arrive to the stadium; there are many differences between the two type of ticket , first of all the customers have to do different queue for reach the service point, indeed the VIP has a different queue that is faster, also the advantage of the VIP the differ-ences are that the customers with the VIP ticket, after they pass the security check, that is mandatory for everyone, they have to do only the check-in, and after they can go to take a seat. In the end there is no queue in the VIP catering service point, in-deed is a buffet already included in the price of their ticket, so they don’t have to pay more to make queue.
